This is a collection of old Javascripts that I wrote to help me automate Photoshop and AfterEffects.
The scripts need a bit of cleanup which I will be doing soon.

#### Notes on AE scripts:
- Create_multiList_SmartImport.jsx : this one is not optimized as far as I remember. It was taking a long time for the script to load a lot of file sequences.

Recently I found a repo which uses python to control photshop :O.
